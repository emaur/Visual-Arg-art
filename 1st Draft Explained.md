 Although this preview may not seem like much, this base is the most important part of my piece. My textual argument — ‘What is Art?’ — will be overlaid on top of this base, as will quotes about these pieces. While technically this base is the background of my piece, it is displaying the most controversial artworks of all time, helping to drive my point home. The arrangement of each image is crucial, as I want to elicit dominance over some by highlighting and emphasizing certain images and allowing others to fall a bit behind. Because not every image is in black and white like I expected, the arrangement of colors is also crucial here; I do not want to emphasize the colors because I am aiming for my text to initially be the main focus due to its bright colors, therefore I needed to spread the colored images out to create balance in the overall piece. In this screenshot, you can see the arrangement I have as of now of my images. It may look haphazardly thrown together — which although is the point — you can see that I have given careful attention to the arrangement. Duchamp’s Fountain is the largest image, simply because this is the piece that essentially sparked the conversation of ‘what is art’ in the art world and beyond. You can also see one of Mapplethorpe’s many self portraits largely scaled in the top left because of the large pentagram in the image. Even if someone wasn’t aware of any of the connotations of these artworks or has never seen any of them before, a pentagram typically means controversy, helping to get my argument across even to an uninformed audience. Similarly, we also see Serrano’s Piss Christ largely scaled on the opposite side of the piece for the exact same reasons. My next steps are to fill in the gaps of the background, and then begin overlaying negative quotes about the controversial images.
