# Project 2: Visual Argument / What is Art?

What is Art? When we think of art, we typically think of a piece hanging in a museum â€” a Picasso, or a Monet. However, controversy after controversy has been experienced in the art world about if an artist's piece can really be considered art. How can a urinal be art? Mapplethorpe's work is too obscene, how can that be art? 

My piece challenges its viewer to consider for themselves what they believe art to be. There is no concrete definition of art, and everyone enjoys art differently. I hope my piece sparks thought in my viewer, as they can begin considering if they believe the images I show in my piece are in fact art to them.
